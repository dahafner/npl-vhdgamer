============

Store your games at one place and distribute them to your PCs fast.

This is a slightly enhanced version, because the original version is no longer maintained.

Enhancements:
- More convenient use
- Server path is now customizable
- Minor fixes and code cleanup

Ideas for the future:
- Moving the codebase to the latest .NET framework
- Allowing the usage of vhdx files
- Creating new virtual disks
- Compacting virtual disks (to reduce transfer time)
- Download over internet
- Manage multiple server locations
- Adding more information inside the virtual disk (for better differentiation)
